Find and replace text within a file using sed command

The procedure to change the text in files under Linux/Unix using sed:

    Use Stream EDitor (sed) as follows:
    sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt
    The s is the substitute command of sed for find and replace
    It tells sed to find all occurrences of ‘old-text’ and replace with ‘new-text’ in a file named input.txt
    Verify that file has been updated:
    more input.txt


Syntax: sed find and replace text

The syntax is:
sed 's/word1/word2/g' input.file
## *bsd/macos sed syntax#
sed 's/word1/word2/g' input.file > output.file
sed -i 's/word1/word2/g' input.file
sed -i -e 's/word1/word2/g' -e 's/xx/yy/g' input.file
## use + separator instead of / ##
sed -i 's+regex+new-text+g' file.txt

The above replace all occurrences of characters in word1 in the pattern space with the corresponding characters from word2. 


Examples that use sed to find and replace

Let us create a text file called hello.txt as follows:
$ cat hello.txt
The is a test file created by nixCrft for demo purpose.
foo is good.
Foo is nice.
I love FOO.

I am going to use s/ for substitute the found expression foo with bar as follows:
sed 's/foo/bar/g' hello.txt

Sample outputs:

The is a test file created by nixCrft for demo purpose.
bar is good.
Foo is nice.
I love FOO.

To update file pass the -i option:
sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' hello.txt
cat hello.txt

The g/ means global replace i.e. find all occurrences of foo and replace with bar using sed. If you removed the /g only first occurrence is changed:
sed -i 's/foo/bar/' hello.txt

The / act as delimiter characters. To match all cases of foo (foo, FOO, Foo, FoO) add I (capitalized I) option as follows:
sed -i 's/foo/bar/gI' hello.txt
cat hello.txt

Sample outputs:

The is a test file created by nixCrft for demo purpose.
bar is good.
bar is nice.
I love bar.

Please note that the BSD implementation of sed (FreeBSD/MacOS and co) does NOT support case-insensitive matching. You need to install gnu sed. Run the following command on Apple Mac OS:
$ brew install gnu-sed

### now use gsed command as follows ##

$ gsed -i 's/foo/bar/gI' hello.txt
$ cat hello.txt
sed command problems

Consider the following text file:
$ cat input.txt
http:// is outdate.
Consider using https:// for all your needs.

Find word ‘http://’ and replace with ‘https://www.cyberciti.biz’:
sed 's/http:///https://www.cyberciti.biz/g' input.txt

You will get an error that read as follows:

sed: 1: "s/http:///https://www.c ...": bad flag in substitute command: '/'

Our syntax is correct but the / delimiter character is also part of word1 and word2 in above example. Sed command allows you to change the delimiter / to something else. So I am going to use +:
sed 's+http://+https://www.cyberciti.biz+g' input.txt

Sample outputs:

https://www.cyberciti.biz is outdate.
Consider using https:// for all your needs.

How to use sed to match word and perform find and replace

In this example only find word ‘love’ and replace it with ‘sick’ if line content a specific string such as FOO:
sed -i -e '/FOO/s/love/sick/' input.txt

Use cat command to verify new changes:
cat input.txt
Recap and conclusion – Using sed to find and replace text in given files

The general syntax is as follows:
## find word1 and replace with word2 using sed ##
sed -i 's/word1/word2/g' input
## you can change the delimiter to keep syntax simple ##
sed -i 's+word1+word2+g' input
sed -i 's_word1_word2_g' input
## you can add I option to GNU sed to case insensitive search ##
sed -i 's/word1/word2/gI' input
sed -i 's_word1_word2_gI' input

See BSD(used on macOS too) sed or GNU sed man page by typing the following command:
man sed
